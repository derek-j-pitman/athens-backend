# athens-sync

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


Steps to test out **Real time collaboration**
1. Click on the `Deploy to Heroku`
2. Follow the on screen instructions to make an app(give it a name) and wait until the setup is finished(~3 mins)
3. In the athens app click on Database/Library icon on the top right and navigate to Remote DB tab
4. Add remote address as `your-app-name.herokuapp.com` and token as `x` (single letter). For eg. if your app name on heroku is `test-app` then the remote address is `test-app.herokuapp.com`
5. Share address and token with your team and start simultaneously working on the same graph!

#### Important Note

This is only a **test deployment** and **all changes will be lost** once heroku dyno reloads(which happens once a day atleast)
